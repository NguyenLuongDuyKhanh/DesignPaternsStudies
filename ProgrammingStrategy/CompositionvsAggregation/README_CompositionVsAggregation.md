# TODO: Investigate the creation and deletion of Composition and Aggregation in both C++ and Python

---

## 🔑 1. Aggregation

* **Definition**: A **whole–part relationship** where one object (the whole) contains or references another (the part).
* **Lifespan**: The part **can exist independently** of the whole.
* **Ownership**: Weak ownership — the whole "uses/knows about" the part but does not control its lifecycle.
* **Example**:

  * A `Library` has many `Books`.
  * Books can exist even without a Library.

**UML Notation**: White diamond → ◇────

**Python Example:**

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title):
        self.title = title

class Library:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.books = []   # aggregation

    def add_book(self, book):
        self.books.append(book)

book = Book("1984")
library = Library("City Library")
library.add_book(book)   # aggregation

# book still exists if library is deleted
```

## 🔑 2. Composition

* **Definition**: A **stronger whole–part relationship** where the part’s lifecycle is **strictly bound** to the whole.
* **Lifespan**: If the whole is destroyed, the parts are also destroyed.
* **Ownership**: Strong ownership — the whole controls the creation and destruction of the parts.
* **Example**:

  * A `House` is made of `Rooms`.
  * Rooms cannot exist without the House.

**UML Notation**: Black diamond → ◆────

**Python Example:**

```python
class Room:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class House:
    def __init__(self, address):
        self.address = address
        self.rooms = [Room("Living Room"), Room("Bedroom")]  # composition

house = House("123 Main St")
# if house is destroyed, rooms are gone too
```

## ✅ Key Differences

| Feature        | Aggregation                | Composition                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Lifespan**   | Part can outlive the whole | Part dies with the whole     |
| **Ownership**  | Weak ownership (shared)    | Strong ownership (exclusive) |
| **Dependency** | Parts independent          | Parts dependent              |
| **UML**        | White diamond ◇            | Black diamond ◆              |
| **Example**    | Library–Books              | House–Rooms                  |

📌 **Summary**

* **Aggregation** = “has-a” relationship, parts exist independently.
* **Composition** = “contains-a” relationship, parts are dependent on the whole.

👉 Do you want me to also draw you a **UML diagram (boxes + diamonds)** showing *Association vs Aggregation vs Composition* side by side? That often clears up confusion.
